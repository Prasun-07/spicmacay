        SPIC MACAY (Society for the Promotion of Indian Classical Music
        And Culture Amongst Youth) is a non-political, nationwide, voluntary
        movement founded in 1977 by Dr Kiran Seth, Professor-Emeritus at
        IIT-Delhi who was awarded the 'Padma Shri' for his contribution to the
        arts in 2009. SPICMACAY's intention is to enrich the quality of formal
        education by increasing awareness about different aspects of Indian
        heritage and inspiring the young mind to imbibe the values embedded in
        it. It seeks to inspire youth through experiencing the mysticism
        embodied in the rich and heterogeneous cultural tapestry of Indian and
        World Heritage, with a hope that the beauty, grace, values and wisdom
        embodied in these arts will influence their way of life and thinking and
        inspire one to become a better human being. For this, the most
        accomplished artistes of the country render programmes of Indian
        Classical music and dance, folk, poetry,theatre, traditional paintings,
        crafts & yoga primarily in schools and colleges. In 2011, SPIC MACAY was
        awarded the Rajiv Gandhi Sadbhavana award in recognition of its
        contribution to youth development.
